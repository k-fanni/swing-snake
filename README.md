# Snake game with Java Swing and SQL
A classic snake game Java application using Swing and a MsSQL database.
The user can choose from 3 levels and like in the classic game, the snake speeds up with each apple eaten.
This version of the game doesn't allow (yet) for the snake to move across the board by leaving the board on one side and re-entering on the other.
Users can save their results to a database, and the top players for each level can be viewed from the menu.
