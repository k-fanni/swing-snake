# Snake game with database
A classic snake game Java application using Swing and a MySQL database.

The user can choose from 3 levels to play, each level has a different size gameboard with the number of obstacles proportional to the size of the gameboard.

The snake speeds up with each apple eaten. If the snake hits an obstacle (rock) or the side of the gameboard, the game ends.

Users can save their results to a database, and the top players for each level can be viewed from the menu.

*This version of the game doesn't allow (yet) for the snake to move across the board by leaving the board on one side and re-entering on the other.*
